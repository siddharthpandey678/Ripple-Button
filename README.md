Ripple Button using HTML, CSS & JavaScript

This project demonstrates a Ripple Button effect built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
When the user clicks the button, a smooth ripple animation appears from the click position, giving a modern and interactive user experience.

The ripple effect is created dynamically using JavaScript by calculating the click coordinates and applying a CSS animation.
This project is lightweight, easy to understand, and does not use any external libraries.

It is ideal for beginners who want to learn DOM manipulation, event handling, and CSS animations, and can be easily customized for use in real-world web applications.
